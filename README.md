This data set includes information about individual bike sharing rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.

The distance traveled and the duration of the bike is used are positively correlated. The number of rides conducted by members are higher in the summer months thant then the winter months. Also, it can be seen that the overall trend from 2017 to 2018 is positive (a higher number of rides was conducted). The mean age is 1984 with a nearly normal distribution.
The top 50 start and end stations almost make 50% of all the rides. Also 46 out of the 50 start and end stations are within both - start and end destination. Moreover, these stations are mostly close to other public transport stations. This should be investigated further for the network planning of the company.
